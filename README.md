# FluxPuppy
Android Interface to Licor LI-820 and LI-840 gas analyzers using Bluetooth and USB ports


## Introduction

FluxPuppy is a mobile Android application for use with the LI-840A gas analyzer. 
The application can be used to observe, collect, and organize data streamed from the analyzer into user specified data sets. 
FluxPuppy is designed to replace the data collection system implemented by LI-COR, by providing many features not present in the current system such as advanced organization, live data readout, and included metadata.

## Installation

### Requirements
In order to successfully use the application, the user will need an Android tablet device running Android 7.0 or higher, as well as an LI-840A gas analyzer and all the cables that come included with it. 

**NOTE:** The software may also work on mobile phone devices running Android 7.0 or higher, but the software was designed for tablet sized screens, and UI elements may appear differently than they do in the manual.

### How To Install FluxPuppy:

1. The installation requires downloading the APK file named “FluxPuppy.apk” from the __binary__ directory on the Github repo. The APK can be found [here](https://github.com/bnasr/FluxPuppy/raw/master/binary/FluxPuppy.apk).
